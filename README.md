# Data-EngineerChallenge
 # The 12-Week Challenge

**Week One Challenge: set Goals**
1. Complete My Modern Data Stack Project
2. Grow as a Data Engineer
3. Advance My Career
   
**Week 2 Road Map:

This week, I’m focusing on continuing to build my Modern Data Stack project.
I’ll keep working on the FastAPI → Kafka → Spark pipeline, integrating Airflow, and starting on infrastructure using Terraform for Azure. I’ll also begin setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

Alongside the project, I’ll spend time daily solving Python and SQL algorithm problems to improve my skills—especially with PySpark
